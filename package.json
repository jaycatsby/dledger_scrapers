  "description": "For retrieving grant data from websites of private foundations in Detroit. Currently, there are two projects in development: a scraper for [Ford Foundation](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/our-grants/grants-database/grants-all) and another one for [Kresge Foundation](http://kresge.org/grants). Since Ford Foundation allows downloadable CSVs, the scraper bot for Ford focuses on opening locally stored CSV of grants and filtering through that list. Meanwhile, scraper for Kresge Foundation currently uses a pre-selected search field url to specifically target grants with 'Detroit' as their 'Program' field.",
